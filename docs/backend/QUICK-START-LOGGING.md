# üöÄ QUICK START: Mobile App Logging

## **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

### **What Just Happened**
‚úÖ **Server-side logging is now ACTIVE** in your SemScan mobile app  
‚úÖ **All session creation and QR scanning events are being logged**  
‚úÖ **Logs are automatically sent to your server**

---

## **üß™ TEST IT NOW**

### **Step 1: Test the Integration**
1. Open the app
2. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Logging Settings**
3. Click **"Test Logging"** button
4. Check your server logs table - you should see test entries

### **Step 2: Test Real Workflow**
1. **Create a session** (as presenter)
2. **Scan QR code** (as student)
3. **Submit attendance**
4. Check server logs - you should see real workflow logs

## **üìä WHAT YOU'LL SEE IN SERVER LOGS**

```sql
-- Check your logs table
SELECT * FROM logs ORDER BY timestamp DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**Expected log entries:**
- `SemScan-UI`: User actions, button clicks
- `SemScan-Session`: Session creation, opening, closing
- `SemScan-QR`: QR code scanning events
- `SemScan-Attendance`: Attendance submissions
- `SemScan-API`: API calls and responses

## **üîç DEBUGGING**

### **If logs are missing:**
```bash
# Check Android logs
adb logcat | grep "SemScan-API"
```
